\usage{
mleCalc(responses, itemParams, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{responses}{a data frame made up of rows of vectors of item responses, one for each case.}

\item{itemParams}{a list of item designs (each used in a call to \code{simplef}). Must be of same length as \code{responses}.}

\item{...}{optional arguments, e.g., perfAdj.}
}
\value{
a data frame.
}
\description{
returns the MLE for each case and asymptotic variance given a \emph{fixed} set of item parameters.
This is done by finding the root of the distance between the observed and expected score at theta.
That is, the location where O-E = 0.
